			Johnstown, NY, Olde Knox Mansion, By: Makiya Smith
		<br>
		<br>
			Slide 2 - Origins and Today
		<br>
		<br>
			Charles Knox
		<br>
			Charles Briggs knox was born on October 8, 1855 in Montgomery County, New York. He married Rose Knox on February 15, 1883. Charles Knox was the founder of the Knox Gelatin Company and in 1890 produced the world’s first pre-granulated gelatin in Johnstown. He then died on January 17, 1908. 
		<br>
		<br>
			Rose Knox
		<br>
			Rose Knox was born on November 18, 1857 in Richland County, Ohio. Rose and her husband started a company in 1891 owned by her husband, but since Charles died in 1908 Rose became the head of the company. Rose changed her company to campaign high nutrition at a low cost and included convenient recipes. She died on September 27, 1950. 
		<br>	
		<br>
			When and What Style
		<br>
			Olde Knox Mansion was built in 1889 with the architectural style of classic revival. 
		<br>
		<br>
			On the Inside
		<br>
			Olde Knox Mansion has 42 rooms, an elevator, a grand staircase, and a solid lava ash fireplace, with several secret rooms and compartments. 
		<br>
		<br>
			After Rose and Charles Knox
		<br>
			As you know, the original owners of Knox Mansion were Rose and Charles Knox, after they died the house was sold to Rose’s doctor, Dr. Larrabee, and after he died it was sold to antique dealers. Which was then bought by Marty Quinn in 1993 who turned it into a museum/ bed and breakfast as well as a private residence.

			Slide 3 - The Daily Gazette
		<br>
			[On <a href="https://dailygazette.com/2008/10/26/1026_knoxmansion/">The Daily Gazette</a> website you’ll find the article of the experiences of the guests at Knox Mansion, in his case the main guests are two sisters who’ll be staying overnight at Knox Mansion.]
		<br>
		<br>
			First Impressions
		<br>
			According to the article, when they arrived they saw that the room was lit by a cozy fireplace and yet eerily empty. Then they brought their suitcases upstairs and even though they hadn’t seen any ghosts, they heard sounds and saw moving shadows.
		<br>
		<br>
			Quinn's Experience
		<br>
			After Quinn had moved into the mansion, paranormal activities began to happen. For example: electronics turned on and off by themselves, vases would break, he would hear voices when he was alone, and he would hear the door open but no one was there. 
		<br>
		<br>
			In the Crawl Space
		<br>
			Quinn said he was in the crawl space with a group of people holding hands while in a circle and they heard, “Psst, hey, I’m over here,” and it sounded like someone was in the corner, when no one was there. 
		<br>
		<br>
			Ghosts and Ghouls
		<br>
			Many people see a ghost gardener by the name of Philip Ulrich, a picture of him is on the wall in the library. Quinn says he’s had kids point at the picture and say that’s the guy. A guest has reported waking up to a man holding a doctors bag over him, who I assume to be Dr. Larrabee. Another person, a plumber, took some mints from a bowl after finishing the job, and they burnt his hands. Quinn himself had seen the plumbers burnt hands.

			Slide 4 - Short Weeks - Long Weekends
		<br>
		<br>
			[This slide is based on the article written by Theresa St. John and can be found on <a href="https://shortweeks-longweekends.com/a-ghostly-stay-awaits-you-at-the-knox-mansion/">Short Weeks - Long Weekends</a>, this article follows Theresa’s experience in Knox Mansion.] 
		<br>
		<br>
			First Impressions
		<br>
			As soon as Theresa arrived at Olde Knox Mansion she said she could feel that it was haunted. Normally encountering ghosts and stuff would excite her, but here, she was tempted to just leave. 
		<br>
		<br>
			The Portraits
		<br>
			In Theresa’s article there is a segment that mentions the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Knox. She said that when she was walking up the staircase, it wasn’t just the eyes that moved, but the whole face. 
		<br>
		<br>
			Sleeping in Olde Knox Mansion
		<br>
			Theresa didn’t have a lot to say about sleeping at Knox Mansion, all she had said about it was that she had slept like a baby and there was nothing to be afraid of.

			About the Book
		<br>
			<i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Olde-Knox-Mansion-Haunted-York/dp/B086PSL895">Olde Knox Mansion, Haunted in New York</a></i> was published on April 4, 2020 and was written by Shelley D. Brienza. Since I don’t own the book, I will read a part of the blurb, “The mansion is believed to be haunted. This is MY story of experiencing what I believed to be a true haunting.It was a cold, wintery night, one New Year’s Eve that I was at a party bringing in the new year. Family and friends gathered together for our traditional get together to dance, eat and be merry. When the clock struck midnight, we all kissed our honeys, and blew our horns and threw our confetti, that had been given to us just before, and now was all over each other and the floor.One of the guests that attended the New Year’s Eve party, he lived across the street. On a whim, he yells out, “Who wants to take a ghost tour of my house ?”This is a true haunted tale of my experience touring the Olde Knox Mansion in Johnstown, NY, one, freezing, cold, New Year's Eve.”
